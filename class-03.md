## list

### HTML provides three different types of list':'

1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered.

'<'ol'>'
The ordered list is created with
the '<'ol'>' element.
'<'li'>'
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening '<'li'>' tag
and a closing '<'/li'>' tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

2. Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point .
3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
